# Monster Orc-arina
**_Monster Orc-arina_** is a cute little toy with a monstrous sound.

## Description
A pick-up-and-play instrument is hard to come by on the Game Boy, as most music carts are complex DAW-type systems with many options. **_Monster Orc-arina_** means to remedy that by giving anyone the ability to create music. 

**Features:**

- Animated parts of the monster indicate octave and note direction
- 3 different instruments, each with a distinct color pattern, allow players to choose their roar
- 3 octaves allow a wide range of notes to play your favorite melodies
- A digital _orc-arina_ to go - ready to scream whenever you are!

**Controls:**

- **Control Pad** (arrows or wasd): Moves the monster's eye and controls note input.
- **B Button** (x, k, ctrl): When held with the Control Pad, it allows access to higher notes.
- **A Button** (z, j, alt): When pressed with UP or DOWN, it changes the octave.
- **Select Button** (shift): Changes between the three sounds/instruments.
- **Start Button** (enter): Selects menu options or allows you to return from How to Play or the Credits.
